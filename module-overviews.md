# Modules overviews

Fork Inc. is a small startup in Hungary. The company previously developed a restaursant software but now they extended their business with a brand new service. A portal and a progressive web application have been created where visitors can choose between restaurants, view the full menu of any restaurant, read reviews from previous guests about the restaurant service and food. They can also book a table at the restaurant of their choice and order and pay through the website or the app.

During the competition days, you will be responsible for developing a prototype of the software components needed for the service. The task is divided into 5 modules:

1. Module A - Promotional website presenting the service
2. Module B - Server side rendered administration page where restaurant owners can manage their own restaurant profile and data
3. Module C - Server-side component that provides commercial APIs for third party applications to access service data
4. Module D - Interactive frontend component for guests who want to use the service
5. Module E - This module has three subparts:
    
    a. Writing automated tests for some JS components of Module D.
    b. To create a simple progressive web application that will be the basis for a future mobile web app.
    c. Create some web components to be used in the web application.
