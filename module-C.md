# Module C - Commercial API Provider

In this module, you will build a server-side component that provides secure and reliable commercial APIs. These APIs will act as wrappers over the existing, less-secure existing APIs. This will allow third-party applications to access the rich data offered by DineEase, enabling integration with other platforms and services within the culinary ecosystem.

## Task List:

### 1. Setup and Initialization
- Create a REST API server using the framework you selected.
- Initialize and configure middleware for parsing JSON, handling CORS, and other relevant settings.

### 2. Security Implementation
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints.
- Ensure data validation for incoming requests to prevent injections and other potential security vulnerabilities.

### 3. Data Integration
- Create endpoints that fetch data from the existing, less-secure APIs. You can find the Open API documentation of the existing API in assets/module-C/API/unsecure-API.yaml file. 
- Store this fetched data temporarily for serving via the commercial APIs, if necessary.

### 4. API Endpoints

#### 4.1. Restaurant Endpoints
- **GET** `/restaurants`: Securely fetch and return a list of all restaurants from the less-secure API.
- **GET** `/restaurants/:id`: Securely fetch and return details of a specific restaurant by ID from the less-secure API.

#### 4.2. Menu Endpoints
- **GET** `/menus`: Securely fetch and return a list of all menus from the less-secure API.
- **GET** `/menus/:restaurantId`: Securely fetch and return menu items of a specific restaurant by ID from the less-secure API.

#### 4.3. Reservation Endpoints
- **GET** `/reservations`: Securely fetch and return a list of all reservations from the less-secure API.
- **POST** `/reservations`: Make a reservation for a restaurant via the less-secure API. 

#### 4.4. Review Endpoints
- **GET** `/reviews`: Securely fetch and return a list of all reviews from the less-secure API.
- **GET** `/reviews/:restaurantId`: Securely fetch and return reviews for a specific restaurant by ID from the less-secure API.

### 5. Reliability Improvements
- Implement caching mechanisms to improve response times and reduce dependencies on the less-secure APIs.
- Implement rate limiting and other measures to prevent abuse of the commercial API.
- Design the API to handle potential failures of the less-secure APIs gracefully.

### 6. API Documentation
- Generate API documentation based on the given OpenAPI specification.
