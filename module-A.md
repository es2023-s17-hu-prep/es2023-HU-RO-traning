# Module A: DineEase Showcase Website

In Module A of the DineEase Web Development Competition, participants will embark on an exciting journey to create an immersive and visually appealing static website for DineEase, a revolutionary dining platform. The website's primary goal is to attract new users and showcase the unique features and offerings of the DineEase service. Competitors will have three hours to demonstrate their HTML and CSS skills to craft a captivating website that adheres to accessibility standards and implements SEO best practices.

## Task List:

### Understanding the Client's Vision: 
Competitors will thoroughly review the provided website structure and detailed pages and sections defined by the client for the DineEase showcase website. This will involve studying the content, images, and media assets that will be supplied by the client.

### Design Alignment: 
Participants will ensure that the design of all subpages is visually aligned, creating a cohesive and harmonious user experience. Consistency in layout, typography, and color schemes is key to reinforcing the DineEase brand identity.

### Accessibility Compliance: 
Competitors will meticulously apply accessibility standards (WCAG) to ensure that the website is inclusive and can be used by all users, regardless of their abilities. This will involve providing alternative text for images, semantic HTML elements, and proper ARIA attributes.

### SEO Best Practices: 
Participants will incorporate SEO best practices into the website's HTML structure, meta tags, and content, optimizing it for search engine visibility and ranking. This will increase DineEase's online presence and attract organic traffic.

### Responsive Design: 
Competitors will implement responsive design techniques to ensure that the DineEase website looks visually appealing and functions flawlessly across three different viewports: mobile, tablet, and desktop. Media queries and flexible layouts will be utilized to achieve responsiveness.

### CSS Preprocessors: 
If desired, competitors may utilize CSS preprocessors such as Sass or Less to streamline their CSS workflow and enhance code maintainability. However, they must ensure that the generated CSS code passes W3C validations.

### Library and Framework Limitations: 
Participants must adhere to the limited set of libraries and frameworks listed in the Infrastructure List. No server-side or client-side frameworks will be allowed for this module, as the focus is on pure HTML and CSS development.

### Creating a Captivating User Interface: 
Competitors will utilize their creativity and design skills to create an engaging user interface that encourages visitors to explore the DineEase platform. This involves effective use of layout, color, typography, and interactive elements.

### User Experience Optimization: 
Participants will pay close attention to user experience (UX) by ensuring intuitive navigation, clear call-to-action buttons, and seamless interactions throughout the website.

### Testing and Validation: 
Before the competition time ends, competitors will thoroughly test the website on the latest stable versions of Google Chrome and Firefox. They will use W3C validators to check for HTML and CSS validity and axe for accessibility testing.

By the end of Module A, each competitor will have crafted an impressive static website that reflects the essence of DineEase's mission and values. The assessment will focus on design aesthetics, accessibility compliance, responsiveness, and overall user experience. The website created in this module will serve as the gateway for users to explore the remarkable world of DineEase.
